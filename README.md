Yozhik
============

Yozhik is the Russian word for Hedgehog. Honestly, it's just a random name.
 
Yozhik is intended to be a go-to set of categories for almost any iOS project.  

Examples
------------

  [myView width]; // concise way to get measurements
  
  [myView resizeToWidth:320]; // easy resizing views
  
  [UIAlertView showWithTitle:@"Title" message:@"My message"]; // easy alert views
